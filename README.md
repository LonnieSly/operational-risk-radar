# operational-risk-radar

## Data Requirements

This diagnostic uses a single item-level sales dataset with the following required fields:
- date
- item
- revenue
- quantity
- contribution_margin

Accepted formats: CSV or XLSX (single sheet)

The system is designed to work with imperfect operational data. All outputs are framed as early risk signals, not definitive conclusions.
